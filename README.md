# Bayesian Network Acquisition from Raw Text

This repository contains the research code, datasets, and results from my doctoral research on extracting causal Bayesian networks from unstructured text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Probabilistic Reasoning.

## Framework Overview
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Causal Network Extraction
- **Rule-based method (SCANER):** Pattern-driven causal extraction.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bayesian Network Construction
- **Rule-based method (LEAPE):** CAST-Logic based prbability estimation.

## üîç Research Highlights
- Domains evaluated: political, food insecurity, and medical texts.  
- Ground truth annotated by three human experts to ensure reliability.  
- Comparative evaluation using F1-scores for causal networks and KL-Divergence for Bayesian Networks.  
- Visualized causal networks using PyVis and NetworkX.  
- Demonstrated that LLM-based approaches can complement rule-based causal discovery systems.
