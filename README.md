This repository contains the research code, datasets, and results from my doctoral research on extracting causal Bayesian networks from unstructured text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Probabilistic Reasoning.

## Framework Overview
### 1️⃣ Causal Network Extraction
- **Rule-based method (SCANER):** Pattern-driven causal extraction.

### 2️⃣ Bayesian Network Construction
- LEAPE: CAST-Logic based prbability estimation
