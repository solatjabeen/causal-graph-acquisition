Sepsis is a serious complication in hospitalized patients. Infection may cause fever. Infection may cause chills. Infection may cause rapid heart rate. Infection triggers systemic inflammation. Systemic inflammation progresses to sepsis. Untreated sepsis leads to hypotension. Untreated sepsis causes hypoperfusion. Hypoperfusion results in organ dysfunction. Organ dysfunction increases likelihood of death. Early antibiotics reduce sepsis progression. Fluid resuscitation reduces hypoperfusion. Heart failure requires monitoring during fluid therapy. Chronic kidney disease requires monitoring during fluid therapy. Hospitals track sepsis bundle compliance. Compliance rates vary across departments. Delayed intervention increases mortality. Lack of infection source control increases mortality.
