Institutional weakness hinders the development of the agriculture sector. Disagreements over land rights for crop cultivation and livestock grazing continue to be a major source of conflict. This insecurity discourages farmers from expanding production. This insecurity discourages traders and retailers from building marketing infrastructure. The extremely low level of public investment in recent decades has meant that essentially no irrigation infrastructure exists. The extremely low level of public investment in recent decades has meant that only 2 percent of South Sudan's limited road network is paved. Roads are poorly maintained. Roads are not repaired. Roads are completely washed out during the rainy season (World Bank 2012; USAID and Fintrac 2012). This inadequate transportation infrastructure makes it difficult for subsistence farmers to transport surpluses to markets. This inadequate transportation infrastructure makes it expensive for subsistence farmers to transport surpluses to markets. Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected to continue during the next two weeks across Sudan. Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected to continue during the next two weeks across South Sudan. Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected to continue during the next two weeks across Uganda. Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected to continue during the next two weeks across northern Kenya. Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected to continue during the next two weeks across western/northern Ethiopia (Figure 3). Persistent heavy rains in the Ethiopian highlands, eastern Sudan, and South Sudan, coupled with highly saturated soils in these areas, are likely to cause flooding in flood-prone areas, as is typical in August. Floods caused by rain have displaced more than 100,000 people in South Sudan, an official said. The displacement raises fears about the devastating impact this displacement could have on food security in the war-torn nation.
