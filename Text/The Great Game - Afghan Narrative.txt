Afghanistan’s prized location at the heart of Asia brought a plague of meddling and self-interested foreign powers to the country. In the 19th century, the British
and Russians battled over Afghanistan to expand their imperial power. After World War
II, the West and the Soviets brought their rivalry to Afghanistan, leading to the Soviet
invasion and civil war. As they tried to seize Afghanistan, foreigners brought with them
violence, instability, and corruption. The 2001 American invasion and occupation is just
the latest in a long series of foreign powers trying to control Afghanistan in pursuit of
their expansionist aims. And like those before them, the Americans will stop at nothing
to maintain their foothold. What these foreigners forget is that no outsider—not even Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan—has ever been able to control Afghanistan in pursuit
of their expansionist aims. History proves that Afghanistan is unconquerable, protected
against foreign domination by warriors committed to defending the homeland and the
faith. Learning from this history, Afghans should not place their trust in foreign powers, who are motivated by their own interests and will undoubtedly be expelled. Afghans
must instead look out for their own interests to maintain their proud history of independence and protect themselves from foreigners’ bloody games.
