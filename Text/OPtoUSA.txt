With inflation easing on the back of lower oil prices and falling commodity prices has allowed RBI to lower interest rates, and further interest rate cuts cannot be ruled out, which would further boost the economic climate and consumer sentiment and create a positive demand environment for the auto sector. Wholesale inflation fell 0.2 % in December, driven by lower gasoline prices. U.S. inflation dropped to 1.6 % in January due to lower fuel prices, hitting a 19-month low. U.S. consumer prices rose modestly last month, weighed down by falling gasoline prices. US consumer prices edge up just 0.1 % in January, weighed down by falling gasoline prices. Data showed U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in November, in line with expectations, due to a sharp decline in gasoline price but underlying inflation pressures remained firm amid rising rents and healthcare costs. In June, we saw an inflation slowdown despite the spike in gasoline prices. Additionally, higher crude prices tend to adversely affect inflation. Furthermore, it was observed that despite higher oil prices, inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy was moderate, and in the euro area it was low. Inflation has been on an uptrend recently thanks mainly to higher oil prices. Surging gasoline prices caused U.S. consumer prices to rise last month at the fastest pace since March. A few days ago, we discussed how soaring oil prices have been a stagflationary double whammy to emerging markets, which have been hit not only by a surging dollar, resulting in a collapse in local currencies and spiking import costs, but a spike in local currency oil and gasoline prices resulting in a surge in inflation and a slowdown in the economy as local infrastructure grinds to a halt.
