The softer inflation figures were attributed to a decline in food prices. Lower prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages drove inflation down last month. Official figures show that the recent fall in food prices has pushed down inflation. In his view, the progress of the comparative base of pork prices - which declined from July 2020 onwards - will boost food inflation, while the tightening of the labour market - with less contracting capacity due to improved employment figures - will do the same with the basic. Food inflation increased to 0.4 percent, the lowest since March 2018 with a significant drop in fresh food prices. The IMF report, which acknowledged the efforts of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to rein in inflation, however, maintained that despite an expected easing of food prices, inflation is projected to remain in double-digits and above the CBN’s target range. Food inflation dipped on account of smaller increases in the prices of non‐cooked food. On the other hand, food inflation dipped to 1.6 per cent last month, on account of smaller increases in the prices of noncooked food and restaurant meals. He said the SBP has accepted that inflation was due to an increase in food prices and that these supply side pressures were likely to be temporary, with an expectation of decline in average inflation within the range of seven to nine percent. If food prices are rising, genuine “main street” inflation is on the rise. Consumer inflation has risen, mostly driven by a surge in pork prices. The CBRT also saw little risk in runaway inflation accelerating from here, despite prices - especially food - still soaring.
