Institutional weakness has further hindered development of the agriculture sector. Disagreements over land rights for crop cultivation and livestock grazing continue to be a major source of conflict. This insecurity discourages farmers from expanding production, and traders and retailers from building marketing infrastructure. The extremely low level of public investment in recent decades has meant that essentially no irrigation infrastructure exists and only 2 percent of South Sudan's limited road network is paved. Roads are poorly maintained, not repaired, and completely washed out during the rainy season (World Bank 2012; USAID and Fintrac 2012). Because of this inadequate transportation infrastructure, it is difficult and expensive for subsistence farmers to transport surpluses to markets.

Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected to continue during the next two weeks across Sudan, South Suda, Uganda, northern Kenya, and western/northern Ethiopia (Figure 3). Persistent heavy rains in the Ethiopian highlands, eastern Sudan, and South Sudan, coupled with highly saturated soils in these areas, is likely to cause flooding in flood-prone areas, as is typical in August.

Floods caused by rain have displaced more than 100,000 people in South Sudan, an official said, raising fears about the devastating impact this could have on food security in the war-torn nation.
