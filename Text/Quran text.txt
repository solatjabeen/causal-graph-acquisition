Indeed, We gave Moses the Book and sent after him successive messengers. 
And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit.
1 Why is it that every time a messenger comes to you ˹Israelites˺ with something you do not like, you become arrogant, rejecting some and killing others?
We have chosen some of those messengers above others.1 Allah spoke directly to some, and raised some high in rank. 
To Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit.
2 If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought ˹among themselves˺ after receiving the clear proofs. 
But they differed—some believed while others disbelieved. 
Yet if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another. But Allah does what He wills.
