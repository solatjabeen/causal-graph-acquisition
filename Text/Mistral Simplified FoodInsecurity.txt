Institutional weakness hinders the development of the agriculture sector further. Disagreements cause a major source of conflict over land rights for crop cultivation and livestock grazing. These disagreements continue. This insecurity does two things. First, it discourages farmers from expanding production. Second, it discourages traders and retailers from building marketing infrastructure.
The level of public investment has been extremely low in recent decades. This low level means two things. First, irrigation infrastructure does not exist. Second, only 2 percent of South Sudan's limited road network is paved. Roads are poorly maintained. Authorities do not repair these roads. The rainy season washes out these roads completely.
Inadequate transportation infrastructure causes two problems. First, it makes transportation difficult for subsistence farmers. Second, it makes transportation expensive for subsistence farmers. These farmers want to transport surpluses to markets.
Moderate to heavy rainfall will continue during the next two weeks across several regions. These regions are Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, northern Kenya, and western/northern Ethiopia. Persistent heavy rains in three areas will likely cause flooding. These areas are the Ethiopian highlands, eastern Sudan, and South Sudan. Soils in these areas are highly saturated. Flooding typically occurs in August.
Floods caused by rain have displaced more than 100,000 people in South Sudan. An official said this. This displacement raises fears about the devastating impact on food security in South Sudan. South Sudan is a war-torn nation.
