Institutional weakness has hindered the development of the agriculture sector. Conflicts arise from disagreements over land rights for crop cultivation and livestock grazing. This insecurity discourages farmers from expanding production. This insecurity also prevents traders and retailers from building marketing infrastructure. Public investment in recent decades has remained extremely low. As a result, irrigation infrastructure does not exist. Only 2 percent of South Sudan's limited road network is paved. Authorities do not maintain roads properly. Authorities do not repair damaged roads. Rain washes out many roads during the rainy season (World Bank 2012; USAID and Fintrac 2012). The inadequate transportation infrastructure makes it difficult for subsistence farmers to transport surpluses to markets. The inadequate infrastructure also makes transportation expensive for subsistence farmers. Moderate to heavy rainfall will continue during the next two weeks across Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, northern Kenya, and western/northern Ethiopia (Figure 3). Heavy rains persist in the Ethiopian highlands, eastern Sudan, and South Sudan. Soils in these areas remain highly saturated. This combination is likely to cause flooding in flood-prone areas, as is typical in August. Heavy rainfall has already caused floods in South Sudan. Floods have displaced more than 100,000 people, according to an official. This situation raises concerns about the devastating impact on food security in the war-torn nation.
