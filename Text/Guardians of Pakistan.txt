Comprised of noble, brave, and holy Muslim warriors, the Pakistan Army arose after Partition to defend the fort of Islam (Islam ka Qilla)—the true home of South Asia’s Muslims. Upon its birth, however, Pakistan immediately faced enemies both abroad and at home: a hostile India threatened Pakistan’s security while corrupt civilian officials threatened the country’s stability and prosperity. The Pakistan Army has always confronted these challenges and defeated Pakistan’s enemies to ensure the survival of the nation: Pakistan’s military martyrs (shahids) sacrificed their blood in battles against India, and the Army removed civilian governments when the people grew tired of corruption and incompetence. These threats, however, persist to this day as Indians engage in malicious plots to undermine the country and civilian governments continue their corrupt and ineffective ways. Pakistanis must support the Army in whatever way that they can, and enlist when possible, so that the Army can remain strong and defend against its enemies. Since the Army is Pakistan’s ultimate savior against the greatest threats facing Pakistan, this unconditional support will ensure the continued safety of both Pakistanis and the nation.
