This narrative stands in direct opposition to the “Victims of Military Rule” narrative, which asserts the Army’s dominance has stifled democracy in Pakistan, though the “Guardians of Pakistan” narrative enjoys considerably broader support. Subscribers to this narrative believe that although Pakistan has endured many hardships since Partition, the Pakistan Army is a notable success story: a widely respected institution that is the country’s only guarantor of security and stability.1 This narrative is reinforced in Pakistanis from a very early age through textbooks and martyrdom stories. Empowered by this unique level of public support, the Pakistan Army believes that it should be independent from unnecessary civilian oversight. Even after the resignation of General-turned-President Pervez Musharraf, the Army holds final say over critical domestic and foreign policy issues, including the nuclear program, the defense budget, and security policy. The “Guardians of Pakistan” narrative routinely reinforces the threat of Indian attack or sabotage in order to remind Pakistanis that the Army is the only thing that stands between them and an Indian military takeover [see also: “Hostile India”]. This narrative is also closely linked with many Pakistanis’ perception that civilian governments are unavoidably corrupt and will ultimately fail the people, necessitating that the Army intervene to restore order and provide basic services. During times of crisis such as the 2010 floods, the Army is often celebrated for its superior ability to provide relief services in comparison with counterparts in the civilian government. Influencers invoke this narrative to shore up support for the Army’s policies and, at times, exert direct control over the civilian government. For instance, in response to a question about whether the Army would launch a coup against the civilian government after its response to the 2010 floods, former President Pervez Musharraf stated that he believed a coup was unlikely, but acknowledged that: “[w]henever the country is in turmoil, everybody looks to the Army.” This narrative has deep undercurrents in Pakistani society, and influencers often invoke it implicitly through the use of songs, videos, and speeches that praise the Army as broader symbol of the nation. For example, in a speech to mark Martyrs’ Day, General Ashfaq Kayani said, “The Army is the nation, and the nation is with the Army.”
