Enemies encircle Pakistan on all sides. These enemies have posed existential threats to Pakistan since its birth. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto launched Pakistan’s nuclear program in response to these enemies. Bhutto declared Pakistan’s commitment and dedication. He said, “If India builds the bomb, Pakistan will eat grass and leaves for a thousand years. Pakistan will even go hungry. But Pakistan will get one of its own.”
Heroes such as AQ Khan showed ingenuity and leadership. Pakistan developed the greatest technological capabilities thanks to these heroes. Pakistan defied Western and Indian attempts to undermine the program. The nuclear bomb proved to the world that Pakistan was the most advanced and powerful Muslim country. This achievement deserves international respect and prestige accordingly.
Pakistan entered the exclusive ranks of the world’s nuclear powers with the nuclear bomb. Today, the United States and India conspire to strip Pakistan's nuclear capability. Pakistan must never give up the bomb. The bomb allows Pakistan to defend itself against existential threats. The bomb makes the world respect Pakistan. The bomb keeps conspiring Indians and Americans in check.
To protect this capability, Pakistanis must support the Army. The Army guards the nuclear arsenal. Pakistanis must also support civilian heroes like Khan. Khan gave Pakistan this great gift. National survival is the reward for this vigilance. The nuclear bomb is the ultimate guarantor of Pakistan’s continued existence in the face of perpetual threats.
