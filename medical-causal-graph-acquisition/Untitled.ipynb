       "      <td>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder characterized by a marked fear of social situations. Treatments for SAD, including exposure therapy and medication, are not satisfactory for all patients. This has led to the development of several paradigms to study social fear in rodents. However, there are still some social impairments observed in SAD patients that have never been examined in rodent models. Indeed, social situations avoided by SAD patients include not only social interactions but also public performances and being observed by others. Nevertheless, tests used to assess sociability in rodents evaluate mostly social interaction in pairs. Thus, we developed a new test-a socially enriched environment test-that evaluates sociability within a group of three unfamiliar conspecifics in an enriched environment. In this study, we induced a SAD-like behavior (i.e., social fear) in male mice using social fear conditioning (SFC) and then tested social fear using the socially enriched environment test and the three-chamber test. Finally, we tested the effects of fear extinction and acute diazepam treatment in reversing social fear. Results revealed, in conditioned mice, decreased object exploration in proximity to conspecifics, social interaction, and mouse-like object exploration. Extinction training, but not acute diazepam treatment, reversed SFC-induced behavioral changes. These findings demonstrate that the socially enriched environment test provides an appropriate behavioral approach to better understand the etiology of SAD. This test may also have important implications in the exploration of new treatments.</td>\n",

This study aimed to examine whether the neurobehavioral effects of a neonicotinoid, clothianidin (CLO), differed between sexes. Male and female C57BL/6 N mice were orally administered CLO (5 or 50 mg/kg) at or below the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and subjected to behavioral tests of emotional and learning functions. Changes in neuroactivity in several brain regions and the concentrations of CLO and its metabolites in blood and urine were measured. Acute CLO exposure caused sex-related behavioral effects; decreases in locomotor activities and elevation of anxiety-like behaviors were more apparent in males than in females. In addition, male-specific impairment of short- and long-term learning memory by CLO exposure was observed in both the novel recognition test and the Barnes maze test. Male-dominant increases in the number of c-fos positive cells were observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the thalamus and in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, which are related to the stress response and learning function, respectively. The concentrations of CLO and most metabolites in blood and urine were higher in males. These results support the notion that male mice are more vulnerable than females to the neurobehavioral effects of CLO and provide novel insights into the risk assessment of neonicotinoids in mammalian neuronal function.</td>\n",

Treatments for SAD, including exposure therapy and medication, are not satisfactory for all patients. This has led to the development of several paradigms to study social fear in rodents. However, there are still some social impairments observed in SAD patients that have never been examined in rodent models. Indeed, social situations avoided by SAD patients include not only social interactions but also public performances and being observed by others. Nevertheless, tests used to assess sociability in rodents evaluate mostly social interaction in pairs. Thus, we developed a new test-a socially enriched environment test-that evaluates sociability within a group of three unfamiliar conspecifics in an enriched environment. In this study, we induced a SAD-like behavior (i.e., social fear) in male mice using social fear conditioning (SFC) and then tested social fear using the socially enriched environment test and the three-chamber test. Finally, we tested the effects of fear extinction and acute diazepam treatment in reversing social fear. Results revealed, in conditioned mice, decreased object exploration in proximity to conspecifics, social interaction, and mouse-like object exploration. Extinction training, but not acute diazepam treatment, reversed SFC-induced behavioral changes. These findings demonstrate that the socially enriched environment test provides an appropriate behavioral approach to better understand the etiology of SAD. This test may also have important implications in the exploration of new treatments.   \n",

Eligible studies investigated patient-led support groups for ICD patients aged 18 years or older, using any quantitative or qualitative design. The Mixed-Methods Assessment Tool was used to assess quality. Meta-analysis of measures of mental well-being was conducted. Thematic synthesis was used to generate analytic themes from the qualitative data. The data were integrated and presented using the Pillar Integration Process.\\nTen studies were included in this review. All studies bar one were non-randomised or had a qualitative design and patients had self-selected to attend a support group. Five contributed to the quantitative data synthesis and seven to the qualitative synthesis. Meta-analysis of anxiety and QoL measures showed no significant impact of support groups on mental well-being, but qualitative data showed that patients perceived benefit from attendance through sharing experiences and acceptance of life with an ICD.\\nICD support group attendance improved the patients' perceived well-being. Attendees value the opportunity to share their experiences which helps to accept their new life with an ICD. Future research could consider outcomes such as patient acceptance and the role of healthcare professionals at support groups.   \n",

This study aimed to examine whether the neurobehavioral effects of a neonicotinoid, clothianidin (CLO), differed between sexes. Male and female C57BL/6 N mice were orally administered CLO (5 or 50 mg/kg) at or below the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and subjected to behavioral tests of emotional and learning functions. Changes in neuroactivity in several brain regions and the concentrations of CLO and its metabolites in blood and urine were measured. Acute CLO exposure caused sex-related behavioral effects; decreases in locomotor activities and elevation of anxiety-like behaviors were more apparent in males than in females. In addition, male-specific impairment of short- and long-term learning memory by CLO exposure was observed in both the novel recognition test and the Barnes maze test. Male-dominant increases in the number of c-fos positive cells were observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the thalamus and in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, which are related to the stress response and learning function, respectively. The concentrations of CLO and most metabolites in blood and urine were higher in males. These results support the notion that male mice are more vulnerable than females to the neurobehavioral effects of CLO and provide novel insights into the risk assessment of neonicotinoids in mammalian neuronal function.   \n",
       "4  Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by an excessive fear of negative social evaluation. There is a limited understanding of how individuals with SAD react physiologically and subjectively to social stress.\\nThe Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), an acute social stress task, was completed by 40 SAD individuals (50% female) and 41 healthy controls (matched on age, sex, and education) to examine salivary cortisol and self-reported stress reactivity. Salivary cortisol concentrations and self-reported affect (anxiety, sadness, tiredness, withdrawal, and happiness) were assessed at baseline and across nine-time points during the TSST.\\nBayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the TSST, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%). Contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect. At baseline, the SAD group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness. In response to the TSST, the SAD group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time. After accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups.\\nDespite elevated subjective anxiety, our findings suggest concordance in psychobiological stress reactivity in SAD and healthy controls. We discuss the possibility of heightened subjective sensitivity to social evaluative stress as a core treatment target for SAD.   \n",

       "4  Bayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the TSST, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%). Contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect. At baseline, the SAD group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness. In response to the TSST, the SAD group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time. After accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups.   \n",

       "4  [social anxiety disorder (sad) is characterised by an excessive fear of negative social evaluation., there is a limited understanding of how individuals with sad react physiologically and subjectively to social stress., the trier social stress test (tsst), an acute social stress task, was completed by 40 sad individuals (50% female) and 41 healthy controls (matched on age, sex, and education) to examine salivary cortisol and self-reported stress reactivity., salivary cortisol concentrations and self-reported affect (anxiety, sadness, tiredness, withdrawal, and happiness) were assessed at baseline and across nine-time points during the tsst., bayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the tsst, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%)., contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect., at baseline, the sad group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness., in response to the tsst, the sad group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time., after accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups., despite elevated subjective anxiety, our findings suggest concordance in psychobiological stress reactivity in sad and healthy controls., we discuss the possibility of heightened subjective sensitivity to social evaluative stress as a core treatment target for sad.]   \n",

       "      <td>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder characterized by a marked fear of social situations. Treatments for SAD, including exposure therapy and medication, are not satisfactory for all patients. This has led to the development of several paradigms to study social fear in rodents. However, there are still some social impairments observed in SAD patients that have never been examined in rodent models. Indeed, social situations avoided by SAD patients include not only social interactions but also public performances and being observed by others. Nevertheless, tests used to assess sociability in rodents evaluate mostly social interaction in pairs. Thus, we developed a new test-a socially enriched environment test-that evaluates sociability within a group of three unfamiliar conspecifics in an enriched environment. In this study, we induced a SAD-like behavior (i.e., social fear) in male mice using social fear conditioning (SFC) and then tested social fear using the socially enriched environment test and the three-chamber test. Finally, we tested the effects of fear extinction and acute diazepam treatment in reversing social fear. Results revealed, in conditioned mice, decreased object exploration in proximity to conspecifics, social interaction, and mouse-like object exploration. Extinction training, but not acute diazepam treatment, reversed SFC-induced behavioral changes. These findings demonstrate that the socially enriched environment test provides an appropriate behavioral approach to better understand the etiology of SAD. This test may also have important implications in the exploration of new treatments.</td>\n",

This study aimed to examine whether the neurobehavioral effects of a neonicotinoid, clothianidin (CLO), differed between sexes. Male and female C57BL/6 N mice were orally administered CLO (5 or 50 mg/kg) at or below the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and subjected to behavioral tests of emotional and learning functions. Changes in neuroactivity in several brain regions and the concentrations of CLO and its metabolites in blood and urine were measured. Acute CLO exposure caused sex-related behavioral effects; decreases in locomotor activities and elevation of anxiety-like behaviors were more apparent in males than in females. In addition, male-specific impairment of short- and long-term learning memory by CLO exposure was observed in both the novel recognition test and the Barnes maze test. Male-dominant increases in the number of c-fos positive cells were observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the thalamus and in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, which are related to the stress response and learning function, respectively. The concentrations of CLO and most metabolites in blood and urine were higher in males. These results support the notion that male mice are more vulnerable than females to the neurobehavioral effects of CLO and provide novel insights into the risk assessment of neonicotinoids in mammalian neuronal function.</td>\n",

Treatments for SAD, including exposure therapy and medication, are not satisfactory for all patients. This has led to the development of several paradigms to study social fear in rodents. However, there are still some social impairments observed in SAD patients that have never been examined in rodent models. Indeed, social situations avoided by SAD patients include not only social interactions but also public performances and being observed by others. Nevertheless, tests used to assess sociability in rodents evaluate mostly social interaction in pairs. Thus, we developed a new test-a socially enriched environment test-that evaluates sociability within a group of three unfamiliar conspecifics in an enriched environment. In this study, we induced a SAD-like behavior (i.e., social fear) in male mice using social fear conditioning (SFC) and then tested social fear using the socially enriched environment test and the three-chamber test. Finally, we tested the effects of fear extinction and acute diazepam treatment in reversing social fear. Results revealed, in conditioned mice, decreased object exploration in proximity to conspecifics, social interaction, and mouse-like object exploration. Extinction training, but not acute diazepam treatment, reversed SFC-induced behavioral changes. These findings demonstrate that the socially enriched environment test provides an appropriate behavioral approach to better understand the etiology of SAD. This test may also have important implications in the exploration of new treatments.   \n",

Eligible studies investigated patient-led support groups for ICD patients aged 18 years or older, using any quantitative or qualitative design. The Mixed-Methods Assessment Tool was used to assess quality. Meta-analysis of measures of mental well-being was conducted. Thematic synthesis was used to generate analytic themes from the qualitative data. The data were integrated and presented using the Pillar Integration Process.\\nTen studies were included in this review. All studies bar one were non-randomised or had a qualitative design and patients had self-selected to attend a support group. Five contributed to the quantitative data synthesis and seven to the qualitative synthesis. Meta-analysis of anxiety and QoL measures showed no significant impact of support groups on mental well-being, but qualitative data showed that patients perceived benefit from attendance through sharing experiences and acceptance of life with an ICD.\\nICD support group attendance improved the patients' perceived well-being. Attendees value the opportunity to share their experiences which helps to accept their new life with an ICD. Future research could consider outcomes such as patient acceptance and the role of healthcare professionals at support groups.   \n",

This study aimed to examine whether the neurobehavioral effects of a neonicotinoid, clothianidin (CLO), differed between sexes. Male and female C57BL/6 N mice were orally administered CLO (5 or 50 mg/kg) at or below the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and subjected to behavioral tests of emotional and learning functions. Changes in neuroactivity in several brain regions and the concentrations of CLO and its metabolites in blood and urine were measured. Acute CLO exposure caused sex-related behavioral effects; decreases in locomotor activities and elevation of anxiety-like behaviors were more apparent in males than in females. In addition, male-specific impairment of short- and long-term learning memory by CLO exposure was observed in both the novel recognition test and the Barnes maze test. Male-dominant increases in the number of c-fos positive cells were observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the thalamus and in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, which are related to the stress response and learning function, respectively. The concentrations of CLO and most metabolites in blood and urine were higher in males. These results support the notion that male mice are more vulnerable than females to the neurobehavioral effects of CLO and provide novel insights into the risk assessment of neonicotinoids in mammalian neuronal function.   \n",
       "4  Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by an excessive fear of negative social evaluation. There is a limited understanding of how individuals with SAD react physiologically and subjectively to social stress.\\nThe Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), an acute social stress task, was completed by 40 SAD individuals (50% female) and 41 healthy controls (matched on age, sex, and education) to examine salivary cortisol and self-reported stress reactivity. Salivary cortisol concentrations and self-reported affect (anxiety, sadness, tiredness, withdrawal, and happiness) were assessed at baseline and across nine-time points during the TSST.\\nBayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the TSST, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%). Contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect. At baseline, the SAD group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness. In response to the TSST, the SAD group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time. After accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups.\\nDespite elevated subjective anxiety, our findings suggest concordance in psychobiological stress reactivity in SAD and healthy controls. We discuss the possibility of heightened subjective sensitivity to social evaluative stress as a core treatment target for SAD.   \n",

       "4  Bayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the TSST, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%). Contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect. At baseline, the SAD group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness. In response to the TSST, the SAD group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time. After accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups.   \n",

       "4  [social anxiety disorder (sad) is characterised by an excessive fear of negative social evaluation., there is a limited understanding of how individuals with sad react physiologically and subjectively to social stress., the trier social stress test (tsst), an acute social stress task, was completed by 40 sad individuals (50% female) and 41 healthy controls (matched on age, sex, and education) to examine salivary cortisol and self-reported stress reactivity., salivary cortisol concentrations and self-reported affect (anxiety, sadness, tiredness, withdrawal, and happiness) were assessed at baseline and across nine-time points during the tsst., bayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the tsst, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%)., contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect., at baseline, the sad group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness., in response to the tsst, the sad group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time., after accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups., despite elevated subjective anxiety, our findings suggest concordance in psychobiological stress reactivity in sad and healthy controls., we discuss the possibility of heightened subjective sensitivity to social evaluative stress as a core treatment target for sad.]   \n",

Treatments for SAD, including exposure therapy and medication, are not satisfactory for all patients. This has led to the development of several paradigms to study social fear in rodents. However, there are still some social impairments observed in SAD patients that have never been examined in rodent models. Indeed, social situations avoided by SAD patients include not only social interactions but also public performances and being observed by others. Nevertheless, tests used to assess sociability in rodents evaluate mostly social interaction in pairs. Thus, we developed a new test-a socially enriched environment test-that evaluates sociability within a group of three unfamiliar conspecifics in an enriched environment. In this study, we induced a SAD-like behavior (i.e., social fear) in male mice using social fear conditioning (SFC) and then tested social fear using the socially enriched environment test and the three-chamber test. Finally, we tested the effects of fear extinction and acute diazepam treatment in reversing social fear. Results revealed, in conditioned mice, decreased object exploration in proximity to conspecifics, social interaction, and mouse-like object exploration. Extinction training, but not acute diazepam treatment, reversed SFC-induced behavioral changes. These findings demonstrate that the socially enriched environment test provides an appropriate behavioral approach to better understand the etiology of SAD. This test may also have important implications in the exploration of new treatments.</td>\n",

This study aimed to examine whether the neurobehavioral effects of a neonicotinoid, clothianidin (CLO), differed between sexes. Male and female C57BL/6 N mice were orally administered CLO (5 or 50 mg/kg) at or below the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and subjected to behavioral tests of emotional and learning functions. Changes in neuroactivity in several brain regions and the concentrations of CLO and its metabolites in blood and urine were measured. Acute CLO exposure caused sex-related behavioral effects; decreases in locomotor activities and elevation of anxiety-like behaviors were more apparent in males than in females. In addition, male-specific impairment of short- and long-term learning memory by CLO exposure was observed in both the novel recognition test and the Barnes maze test. Male-dominant increases in the number of c-fos positive cells were observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the thalamus and in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, which are related to the stress response and learning function, respectively. The concentrations of CLO and most metabolites in blood and urine were higher in males. These results support the notion that male mice are more vulnerable than females to the neurobehavioral effects of CLO and provide novel insights into the risk assessment of neonicotinoids in mammalian neuronal function.</td>\n",

Treatments for SAD, including exposure therapy and medication, are not satisfactory for all patients. This has led to the development of several paradigms to study social fear in rodents. However, there are still some social impairments observed in SAD patients that have never been examined in rodent models. Indeed, social situations avoided by SAD patients include not only social interactions but also public performances and being observed by others. Nevertheless, tests used to assess sociability in rodents evaluate mostly social interaction in pairs. Thus, we developed a new test-a socially enriched environment test-that evaluates sociability within a group of three unfamiliar conspecifics in an enriched environment. In this study, we induced a SAD-like behavior (i.e., social fear) in male mice using social fear conditioning (SFC) and then tested social fear using the socially enriched environment test and the three-chamber test. Finally, we tested the effects of fear extinction and acute diazepam treatment in reversing social fear. Results revealed, in conditioned mice, decreased object exploration in proximity to conspecifics, social interaction, and mouse-like object exploration. Extinction training, but not acute diazepam treatment, reversed SFC-induced behavioral changes. These findings demonstrate that the socially enriched environment test provides an appropriate behavioral approach to better understand the etiology of SAD. This test may also have important implications in the exploration of new treatments.   \n",

Eligible studies investigated patient-led support groups for ICD patients aged 18 years or older, using any quantitative or qualitative design. The Mixed-Methods Assessment Tool was used to assess quality. Meta-analysis of measures of mental well-being was conducted. Thematic synthesis was used to generate analytic themes from the qualitative data. The data were integrated and presented using the Pillar Integration Process.\\nTen studies were included in this review. All studies bar one were non-randomised or had a qualitative design and patients had self-selected to attend a support group. Five contributed to the quantitative data synthesis and seven to the qualitative synthesis. Meta-analysis of anxiety and QoL measures showed no significant impact of support groups on mental well-being, but qualitative data showed that patients perceived benefit from attendance through sharing experiences and acceptance of life with an ICD.\\nICD support group attendance improved the patients' perceived well-being. Attendees value the opportunity to share their experiences which helps to accept their new life with an ICD. Future research could consider outcomes such as patient acceptance and the role of healthcare professionals at support groups.   \n",

This study aimed to examine whether the neurobehavioral effects of a neonicotinoid, clothianidin (CLO), differed between sexes. Male and female C57BL/6 N mice were orally administered CLO (5 or 50 mg/kg) at or below the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and subjected to behavioral tests of emotional and learning functions. Changes in neuroactivity in several brain regions and the concentrations of CLO and its metabolites in blood and urine were measured. Acute CLO exposure caused sex-related behavioral effects; decreases in locomotor activities and elevation of anxiety-like behaviors were more apparent in males than in females. In addition, male-specific impairment of short- and long-term learning memory by CLO exposure was observed in both the novel recognition test and the Barnes maze test. Male-dominant increases in the number of c-fos positive cells were observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the thalamus and in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, which are related to the stress response and learning function, respectively. The concentrations of CLO and most metabolites in blood and urine were higher in males. These results support the notion that male mice are more vulnerable than females to the neurobehavioral effects of CLO and provide novel insights into the risk assessment of neonicotinoids in mammalian neuronal function.   \n",
       "4  Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by an excessive fear of negative social evaluation. There is a limited understanding of how individuals with SAD react physiologically and subjectively to social stress.\\nThe Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), an acute social stress task, was completed by 40 SAD individuals (50% female) and 41 healthy controls (matched on age, sex, and education) to examine salivary cortisol and self-reported stress reactivity. Salivary cortisol concentrations and self-reported affect (anxiety, sadness, tiredness, withdrawal, and happiness) were assessed at baseline and across nine-time points during the TSST.\\nBayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the TSST, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%). Contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect. At baseline, the SAD group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness. In response to the TSST, the SAD group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time. After accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups.\\nDespite elevated subjective anxiety, our findings suggest concordance in psychobiological stress reactivity in SAD and healthy controls. We discuss the possibility of heightened subjective sensitivity to social evaluative stress as a core treatment target for SAD.   \n",

All studies bar one were non-randomised or had a qualitative design and patients had self-selected to attend a support group. Five contributed to the quantitative data synthesis and seven to the qualitative synthesis. Meta-analysis of anxiety and QoL measures showed no significant impact of support groups on mental well-being, but qualitative data showed that patients perceived benefit from attendance through sharing experiences and acceptance of life with an ICD.   \n",

       "4  Bayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the TSST, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%). Contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect. At baseline, the SAD group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness. In response to the TSST, the SAD group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time. After accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups.   \n",

       "4  [social anxiety disorder (sad) is characterised by an excessive fear of negative social evaluation., there is a limited understanding of how individuals with sad react physiologically and subjectively to social stress., the trier social stress test (tsst), an acute social stress task, was completed by 40 sad individuals (50% female) and 41 healthy controls (matched on age, sex, and education) to examine salivary cortisol and self-reported stress reactivity., salivary cortisol concentrations and self-reported affect (anxiety, sadness, tiredness, withdrawal, and happiness) were assessed at baseline and across nine-time points during the tsst., bayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the tsst, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%)., contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect., at baseline, the sad group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness., in response to the tsst, the sad group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time., after accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups., despite elevated subjective anxiety, our findings suggest concordance in psychobiological stress reactivity in sad and healthy controls., we discuss the possibility of heightened subjective sensitivity to social evaluative stress as a core treatment target for sad.]   \n",

       "      <td>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder characterized by a marked fear of social situations. Treatments for SAD, including exposure therapy and medication, are not satisfactory for all patients. This has led to the development of several paradigms to study social fear in rodents. However, there are still some social impairments observed in SAD patients that have never been examined in rodent models. Indeed, social situations avoided by SAD patients include not only social interactions but also public performances and being observed by others. Nevertheless, tests used to assess sociability in rodents evaluate mostly social interaction in pairs. Thus, we developed a new test-a socially enriched environment test-that evaluates sociability within a group of three unfamiliar conspecifics in an enriched environment. In this study, we induced a SAD-like behavior (i.e., social fear) in male mice using social fear conditioning (SFC) and then tested social fear using the socially enriched environment test and the three-chamber test. Finally, we tested the effects of fear extinction and acute diazepam treatment in reversing social fear. Results revealed, in conditioned mice, decreased object exploration in proximity to conspecifics, social interaction, and mouse-like object exploration. Extinction training, but not acute diazepam treatment, reversed SFC-induced behavioral changes. These findings demonstrate that the socially enriched environment test provides an appropriate behavioral approach to better understand the etiology of SAD. This test may also have important implications in the exploration of new treatments.</td>\n",

This study aimed to examine whether the neurobehavioral effects of a neonicotinoid, clothianidin (CLO), differed between sexes. Male and female C57BL/6 N mice were orally administered CLO (5 or 50 mg/kg) at or below the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and subjected to behavioral tests of emotional and learning functions. Changes in neuroactivity in several brain regions and the concentrations of CLO and its metabolites in blood and urine were measured. Acute CLO exposure caused sex-related behavioral effects; decreases in locomotor activities and elevation of anxiety-like behaviors were more apparent in males than in females. In addition, male-specific impairment of short- and long-term learning memory by CLO exposure was observed in both the novel recognition test and the Barnes maze test. Male-dominant increases in the number of c-fos positive cells were observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the thalamus and in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, which are related to the stress response and learning function, respectively. The concentrations of CLO and most metabolites in blood and urine were higher in males. These results support the notion that male mice are more vulnerable than females to the neurobehavioral effects of CLO and provide novel insights into the risk assessment of neonicotinoids in mammalian neuronal function.</td>\n",

Treatments for SAD, including exposure therapy and medication, are not satisfactory for all patients. This has led to the development of several paradigms to study social fear in rodents. However, there are still some social impairments observed in SAD patients that have never been examined in rodent models. Indeed, social situations avoided by SAD patients include not only social interactions but also public performances and being observed by others. Nevertheless, tests used to assess sociability in rodents evaluate mostly social interaction in pairs. Thus, we developed a new test-a socially enriched environment test-that evaluates sociability within a group of three unfamiliar conspecifics in an enriched environment. In this study, we induced a SAD-like behavior (i.e., social fear) in male mice using social fear conditioning (SFC) and then tested social fear using the socially enriched environment test and the three-chamber test. Finally, we tested the effects of fear extinction and acute diazepam treatment in reversing social fear. Results revealed, in conditioned mice, decreased object exploration in proximity to conspecifics, social interaction, and mouse-like object exploration. Extinction training, but not acute diazepam treatment, reversed SFC-induced behavioral changes. These findings demonstrate that the socially enriched environment test provides an appropriate behavioral approach to better understand the etiology of SAD. This test may also have important implications in the exploration of new treatments.   \n",

Eligible studies investigated patient-led support groups for ICD patients aged 18 years or older, using any quantitative or qualitative design. The Mixed-Methods Assessment Tool was used to assess quality. Meta-analysis of measures of mental well-being was conducted. Thematic synthesis was used to generate analytic themes from the qualitative data. The data were integrated and presented using the Pillar Integration Process.\\nTen studies were included in this review. All studies bar one were non-randomised or had a qualitative design and patients had self-selected to attend a support group. Five contributed to the quantitative data synthesis and seven to the qualitative synthesis. Meta-analysis of anxiety and QoL measures showed no significant impact of support groups on mental well-being, but qualitative data showed that patients perceived benefit from attendance through sharing experiences and acceptance of life with an ICD.\\nICD support group attendance improved the patients' perceived well-being. Attendees value the opportunity to share their experiences which helps to accept their new life with an ICD. Future research could consider outcomes such as patient acceptance and the role of healthcare professionals at support groups.   \n",

This study aimed to examine whether the neurobehavioral effects of a neonicotinoid, clothianidin (CLO), differed between sexes. Male and female C57BL/6 N mice were orally administered CLO (5 or 50 mg/kg) at or below the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and subjected to behavioral tests of emotional and learning functions. Changes in neuroactivity in several brain regions and the concentrations of CLO and its metabolites in blood and urine were measured. Acute CLO exposure caused sex-related behavioral effects; decreases in locomotor activities and elevation of anxiety-like behaviors were more apparent in males than in females. In addition, male-specific impairment of short- and long-term learning memory by CLO exposure was observed in both the novel recognition test and the Barnes maze test. Male-dominant increases in the number of c-fos positive cells were observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the thalamus and in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, which are related to the stress response and learning function, respectively. The concentrations of CLO and most metabolites in blood and urine were higher in males. These results support the notion that male mice are more vulnerable than females to the neurobehavioral effects of CLO and provide novel insights into the risk assessment of neonicotinoids in mammalian neuronal function.   \n",
       "4  Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by an excessive fear of negative social evaluation. There is a limited understanding of how individuals with SAD react physiologically and subjectively to social stress.\\nThe Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), an acute social stress task, was completed by 40 SAD individuals (50% female) and 41 healthy controls (matched on age, sex, and education) to examine salivary cortisol and self-reported stress reactivity. Salivary cortisol concentrations and self-reported affect (anxiety, sadness, tiredness, withdrawal, and happiness) were assessed at baseline and across nine-time points during the TSST.\\nBayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the TSST, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%). Contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect. At baseline, the SAD group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness. In response to the TSST, the SAD group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time. After accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups.\\nDespite elevated subjective anxiety, our findings suggest concordance in psychobiological stress reactivity in SAD and healthy controls. We discuss the possibility of heightened subjective sensitivity to social evaluative stress as a core treatment target for SAD.   \n",

All studies bar one were non-randomised or had a qualitative design and patients had self-selected to attend a support group. Five contributed to the quantitative data synthesis and seven to the qualitative synthesis. Meta-analysis of anxiety and QoL measures showed no significant impact of support groups on mental well-being, but qualitative data showed that patients perceived benefit from attendance through sharing experiences and acceptance of life with an ICD.   \n",

       "4  Bayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the TSST, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%). Contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect. At baseline, the SAD group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness. In response to the TSST, the SAD group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time. After accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups.   \n",

       "4  [social anxiety disorder (sad) is characterised by an excessive fear of negative social evaluation., there is a limited understanding of how individuals with sad react physiologically and subjectively to social stress., the trier social stress test (tsst), an acute social stress task, was completed by 40 sad individuals (50% female) and 41 healthy controls (matched on age, sex, and education) to examine salivary cortisol and self-reported stress reactivity., salivary cortisol concentrations and self-reported affect (anxiety, sadness, tiredness, withdrawal, and happiness) were assessed at baseline and across nine-time points during the tsst., bayesian salivary cortisol analyses revealed no group differences in salivary cortisol levels at baseline or during the tsst, with results comparative after the removal of 17 cortisol non-responders (21%)., contrastingly, the groups significantly differed on self-reported affect., at baseline, the sad group (vs. controls) reported heightened negative affect and diminished happiness., in response to the tsst, the sad group (vs. controls) displayed greater negative affect reactivity and diminished happiness reactivity, and significantly higher rates of change in their anxiety and sadness over time., after accounting for differences in the temporal resolution of self-reported versus cortisol responses, a moderate positive association was found between salivary cortisol and anxiety reactivity to social stress that was comparable between the groups., despite elevated subjective anxiety, our findings suggest concordance in psychobiological stress reactivity in sad and healthy controls., we discuss the possibility of heightened subjective sensitivity to social evaluative stress as a core treatment target for sad.]   \n",
